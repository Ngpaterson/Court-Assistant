# Real-Time Transcription Architecture

This document describes the improved real-time transcription engine architecture with overlap buffering that replaces the previous HTTP/SSE-based system with a more efficient CPU-optimized approach using sounddevice and native Electron IPC.

## Architecture Overview

The improved system consists of three main components:

1. **Python Transcription Engine** (`python/realtime_transcriber.py`) - Enhanced with overlap buffering
2. **Python Transcription Server** (`python/transcription_server.py`) - Updated with improved parameters
3. **Electron Transcription Manager** (`backend/transcriptionManager.js`)

## Component Details

### 1. Python Transcription Engine (`realtime_transcriber.py`)

**Purpose**: Core transcription engine using sounddevice for audio capture and faster-whisper for transcription with overlap buffering to prevent word loss.

**Key Improvements**:
- **Reduced chunk duration**: 3.0s → 2.0s for faster processing and lower latency
- **Overlap buffering**: 0.5s overlap between chunks to prevent word truncation at boundaries
- **Improved audio blocksize**: 0.1s (1600 samples) for better real-time responsiveness
- **Enhanced temp file management**: Better cleanup even on exceptions
- Uses `sounddevice` for real-time microphone input
- Uses `faster-whisper` with CPU optimization (`device="cpu"`, `compute_type="int8"`)
- Thread-safe audio processing and transcription

**Improved Configuration**:
```python
transcriber = RealtimeTranscriber(
    sample_rate=16000,          # Audio sample rate
    chunk_duration=2.0,         # Reduced from 3.0s for faster processing
    overlap_duration=0.5,       # NEW: 0.5s overlap to prevent word loss
    device="cpu",               # CPU-only processing
    compute_type="int8"         # Efficient integer quantization
)
```

**Overlap Buffering Details**:
- Each processing chunk includes the previous 0.5s overlap
- The next overlap is prepared from the end of the current chunk
- Prevents word truncation at chunk boundaries
- Maintains temporal continuity in transcription

### 2. Python Transcription Server (`transcription_server.py`)

**Purpose**: Communication bridge between the Python transcription engine and Electron.

**Improved Features**:
- Runs the enhanced transcription engine as a subprocess
- Communicates with Electron via stdin/stdout (JSON messages)
- Handles commands from Electron (start, stop, clear, status)
- Sends transcription updates and errors back to Electron
- Reports improved capabilities to frontend

**Message Format**:
```json
{
    "type": "transcription|error|status|ready",
    "data": {...},
    "timestamp": 1234567890.123
}
```

**Enhanced Ready Message**:
```json
{
    "type": "ready",
    "data": {
        "message": "Improved transcription server ready",
        "capabilities": {
            "device": "cpu",
            "compute_type": "int8",
            "sample_rate": 16000,
            "chunk_duration": 2.0,
            "overlap_duration": 0.5,
            "blocksize": 1600,
            "features": [
                "overlap_buffering",
                "improved_responsiveness", 
                "reduced_word_loss",
                "faster_processing"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Electron Transcription Manager (`transcriptionManager.js`)

**Purpose**: Manages the Python transcription server process and handles IPC communication.

**Key Features**:
- Spawns and manages Python transcription server process
- Handles IPC communication between frontend and Python server
- Manages session lifecycle (start, stop, clear)
- Forwards transcription updates to frontend components
- Handles error reporting and recovery

pip install faster-whisper==0.10.0 sounddevice numpy
```

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum (4GB recommended)
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for real-time processing

- **Python**: 3.8+ with required packages

## Configuration Options

### Transcriber Parameters
```python
RealtimeTranscriber(
    sample_rate=16000,           # Audio sample rate (Hz)
    chunk_duration=2.0,          # Chunk size in seconds
    overlap_duration=0.5,        # Overlap between chunks in seconds
    device="cpu",                # Processing device ("cpu" or "cuda")
    compute_type="int8"          # Quantization type
)
```

### Performance Tuning
- **Faster Processing**: Reduce `chunk_duration` to 1.5s
- **Better Accuracy**: Increase `overlap_duration` to 0.75s
- **Lower Memory**: Reduce `overlap_duration` to 0.25s
- **GPU Processing**: Set `device="cuda"` (if available)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone Access Denied**
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted
   - Check system audio settings
   - Verify sounddevice can access microphone

2. **Python Server Not Starting**
   - Verify Python dependencies are installed
   - Check Python path and environment
   - Ensure sounddevice works with your audio system

3. **Transcription Not Working**
   - Check if Whisper model is downloading (first run)
   - Verify audio input is working
   - Check console for error messages
   - Ensure adequate system resources

4. **Poor Transcription Quality**
   - Improve microphone setup (closer, clearer)
   - Reduce background noise in environment
   - Speak clearly and at moderate pace
   - Check audio levels in system settings

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
export DEBUG_TRANSCRIPTION=1
export DEBUG_AUDIO=1
export DEBUG_OVERLAP=1
```
